# Data Science Web Driven Development

## Using Open Source Technologies

### Description
The job recommendation system is a web application designed to provide personalized job recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior. It employs various machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering and natural language processing (NLP), to suggest relevant job listings.

**Machine Learning:** Developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, but rather by learning patterns from data.

**Data Science:** Extracting insights and knowledge from data through various techniques and tools, including ML, statistics, and domain-specific expertise.

### Supervised Machine Learning Models Used
1. **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends jobs based on user interactions and preferences.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Analyzes job descriptions and user profiles to identify similar jobs by text classification.
3. **K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**

### Technologies Used
- **Python/Django:** Backend development framework.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS:** Frontend development.
- **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL:** Database management.
- **Bootstrap/Crispy Forms:** Frontend styling.
- **TfidfVectorizer:** Feature extraction for NLP.
- **NearestNeighbors:** Model for finding similar items.
- **Linear_kernel:** Computes cosine similarity.
- **Django Forms:** User input handling.
- **Django Authentication:** User authentication.

### Functionality
The app allows users to:
- Browse job listings.
- View detailed job descriptions.
- Receive personalized job recommendations based on their profile and past interactions.
- Explore similar jobs based on job category and description.
- Apply for jobs directly through the platform.

### Real-World Application
In real-world scenarios, this app can serve as a valuable tool for job seekers by:
- Providing tailored job suggestions, saving time in the job search process.
- Enhancing user experience on job platforms.
- Improving job matching accuracy between candidates and employers.
- Increasing user engagement and retention on job portals.
